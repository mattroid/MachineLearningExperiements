# A Study of Machine Learning and it's Applications

## Deep Dive

I've found a need to dive deeply and learn comprehensivly about a particular
subject. In my survey of the computer science landscape I find that the
applications of machine learning are extreamly interesting and a worth while
area of the field to persue in depth. 

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Recognition - Unique facial recognition
### Experiment 1: learning - Apply new faces to classification network

### Experiment 2: Recognition - Identifying buttons on a page
### Experiment 2: Learning - Find paths through an application
